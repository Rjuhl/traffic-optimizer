# Optimizing Traffic in Urban Centers

**Status**: Work in Progress 

## Overview

No one likes sitting in traffic—especially during rush hour. Urban intersections often become major bottlenecks, causing backups and congestion that ripple through entire city grids. This project aims to explore and improve traffic flow by experimenting with smarter traffic light timing strategies.

While many intersections use basic algorithms and sensor data to time their lights, there's significant room for improvement—especially with the potential of machine learning systems. However, testing new strategies in the real world is difficult, which is why this project exists.

## Project Goals

This project provides a platform for simulating traffic in urban environments. It allows users to:

- Design custom traffic maps via a user interface  
- Simulate traffic flow across intersections  
- Import real-world map data from online datasets  
- Create custom traffic light control strategies through a programmable `Strategy` object

The `Strategy` object can access real-time simulation data to make intelligent decisions about traffic light timing. It can be implemented using traditional algorithms, AI/ML agents, or other innovative approaches.

## Why This Matters

This simulation environment is designed to support rapid prototyping and testing of programmatic solutions to optimize stoplight timing. Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or just someone who hates traffic, this tool offers a way to explore smarter traffic management strategies—without needing access to real-world infrastructure.


Stay tuned as the project develops!
